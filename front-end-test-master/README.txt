This is a test task for a Junior front-end developer position in Vocter company.
http://vocter.com

Initial idea was taken from http://autoprotech.ua/ so you can take a look how a similar functionality forks there.

Look at a PSD file in the repo and create a markup for a module described in it.

- Plans (basic, standard etc) should be selected via cursor hover.
- List of partial plans should be hidden and might be opened via click on a 'partials' dropdown (a blue one).
- Parts under the main picture should be hidden until a user selects some of partial plans.
- Default plan should be Standard++. It should be selected after initial loading and after change a car class (mini, middle or premium) as well.
- When the car class was changed it should be marked with a little arrow under the selected class block.
- The task should be done with HTML, CSS and JS. jQuery is the only additional library that might be used but it's not requried. Yes, it means do NOT use Bootstrap.

A result should be sent to victor.djangirov@vocter.com
